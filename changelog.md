## Resourcify 1.6.0

### New features

- Add **CurseForge support for updating**! Resourcify will now check both Modrinth and Curseforge for updates, and you
  can choose which source to use per project.
- When possible, links to modrinth in a project description will now be opened in Resourcify (this is configurable in
  the config).
- Add support for side mouse buttons to go back and forward between pages.

### Fixes

- Fix CurseForge version filter using major version instead of exact version.
- You can now select multiple Minecraft versions when using the CurseForge source.
