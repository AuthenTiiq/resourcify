### Changes
This update is mostly to update dependencies and fix some small issues

- (1.21.x NeoForge) Fixed a crash when opening Resourcify's config
- (Fabric) Shade UniversalCraft instead of including it as a jar to resolve Essential asking for a dependency update (this would usually go away after a relaunch, but for some users it didn't, this update will resolve that)
- Dependency updates:
  - Updated UniversalCraft to 363
  - (1.8.9 and 1.12.2 forge) Updated bundled kotlin to 2.0.20
