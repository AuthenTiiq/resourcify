## Resourcify 1.4.3

Please make sure to report any bugs and/or visual anomalies on [Resourcify's GitHub](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/issues) or in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XtAuqsJWby).

### Changes
- Fix buttons getting re-created too many times, causing the fancy menu widget locator to change
- Fix modrinth gallery images using low-res images when opening them
- Use linear scaling for images instead of nearest neighbour scaling, fixes modrinth banners and logos looking pixelated due to modrinth switching to lower-resolution images for them.
- Switch to smaller thumbnail images for search and un-opened gallery images, improves gallery image loading speed, especially on slower connections
