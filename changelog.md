## Resourcify 1.5.1

- Added support for 1.21.3 neoforge and forge! (Note: at the time of writing kotlin for forge does not have a version
  marked as compatible for 1.21.3, but **kotlin for forge 5.6.0 seems to work for 1.21.3**)
- Fixed a crash when opening the changelog of a project in the update screen
- Fixed a crash caused by a project having an invalid image URL
